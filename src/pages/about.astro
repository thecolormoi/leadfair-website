      <div class="prose prose-lg text-text-light space-y-6">
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I'm Jeremy Turner. I own a music school in Huntsville, Alabama called Alabama Music Academy. After years of running it, I hit a wall that a lot of small business owners know well: I was spending more time on admin, phone calls, and marketing than on the actual work I started the business to do.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Missed calls were costing me students. Manual scheduling was eating my evenings. And when it came to being found online? I was barely visible, even though I'd been in business for years.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          So I started building solutions. An AI phone agent to handle calls. Automations to eliminate busywork. A visibility strategy that actually worked for a local business. And it clicked — these weren't just solving my problems. They could solve the same problems for thousands of small businesses.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          That's LeadFair. We take the AI tools and visibility strategies that actually work — the ones I use on my own business every day — and implement them for other small businesses. No hype, no buzzwords, no six-month timelines. Just practical tools that make your business run better and get found by more customers.
